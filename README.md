>Smart Cleaner is a cross-platform application for zeroing, 
> mashing and deleting files. Delete a folder. Uses Python 3, 
> Pyside2, and mycleaner. File mashing in 
> Windows is under development and research. 
> If you add the entire folder, all the attached files and 
> folders will be added recursively. 
> Be very careful when resetting or erasing files, 
> as it will be very difficult or impossible to 
> restore them. Works successfully on Linux (all), Windows (all)
