Description
---

>Smart Cleaner 
> The program allows you to destroy files 
> zero data and delete files, 
> for complete or partial difficulty in 
> restoring them after deletion.

>Smart Cleaner is a cross-platform application for zeroing, 
> mashing and deleting files. Delete a folder. Uses Python 3, 
> Pyside2, and [mycleaner](https://github.com/mysmarthub/mycleaner). File mashing in 
> Windows is under development and research.

>If you add the entire folder, all the attached files and 
> folders will be added recursively. 
> Be very careful when resetting or erasing files, 
> as it will be very difficult or impossible to 
> restore them. Works successfully on Linux (all), [Windows](https://sourceforge.net/projects/smart-cleaner-for-windows/files/latest/download) (all).
