Description

    Smart Cleaner
    -------------------------------------------------------
    The program allows you to destroy files
        zero data and delete files,
        for complete or partial difficulty in
        restoring them after deletion.

>Smart Cleaner is a cross-platform application for zeroing, 
mashing and deleting files. Delete a folder. Uses Python 3, 
Pyside2, and mycleaner. File mashing in 
Windows is under development and research.

>If you add the entire folder, all the attached files and 
folders will be added recursively. 
Be very careful when resetting or erasing files, 
as it will be very difficult or impossible to 
restore them. Works successfully on Linux (all), Windows (all).
